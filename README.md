vcf-to-qtdt
===========
This was a project I completed for a Bioinformatics course at the University of Michigan in the Fall of 2013.
The program takes a VCF file and converts that file into proper QTDT format for use in pedigree analysis programs, with proper user input about the orginal data uploaded
It can be found in its 1.0 stage at the web at https://vcf-to-qtdt-converter.herokuapp.com
